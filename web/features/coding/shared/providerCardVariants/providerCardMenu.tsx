 * behind a divider. These were in the bespoke cards before the styles were
 * extracted; a migration that dropped the icons or flattened the divider
 * produces a menu that looks like a different product while still working, and
 * nothing fails (see `providerCardVariants/AGENTS.md`, "「更多」菜单是契约").
 *
 * Shared by the two Claude/Codex-style list cards and the compact card view.
 * The OpenCode style does not use it: its actions are header icon buttons.
 *
 * Built on antd `Dropdown` rather than the Skills page's `ManagementMenu`
 * because the enable row contains a real `<Switch>`; `ManagementMenu` renders
 * its entries as `<button>`, and nesting an interactive control inside one is
 * invalid markup.
